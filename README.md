![excel_ai_summary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/941323ac-6333-422b-a72e-426dc137bc6b)

I’ve just completed a full-stack demo project focused on solving a very real business problem:

Turning raw Excel KPI data into AI-generated executive reports — automatically.

                                          Business Problem

In many companies, KPI tracking still happens in Excel.

Managers spend hours analyzing performance changes, risks, and operational issues manually.

                This project automates that process end-to-end.

⚙️ What the system does

1️⃣ Upload Excel KPI file

2️⃣ Analyze performance changes

3️⃣ Detect risks & negative trends

4️⃣ Generate AI executive summary

5️⃣ Create branded PDF report

6️⃣ Visualize KPI changes with charts

All in one flow.
